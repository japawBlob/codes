### Bouncing ball example in JavaFX

Based on Swing example from PJV. A non-deprecated Observable-Observer implementation is used. Four proposed ball rendering methods are implemented:

1. Drawing a shape on `Canvas`

2. Drawing an `Image` on `Canvas`

3. Moving a JavaFX `Circle` instance on `Pane`

4. Moving a JavaFX `ImageView` instance on `Pane`
